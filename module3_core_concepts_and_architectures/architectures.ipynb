    "The multi-agent design of the architecture is easier to maintain, understand and extend than a single agent system. Even for the single agent based interface, a multi-agent implementation can potentially make the system more modular, and easier for developers to add or remove components of functionality. It's very important to recognize that the multi-agent architecture is a good way to build a single agent. While not obvious, it has a root in the society of mind theory by Marvin Minsky in 1986. Starting from simple agents, one can compose and coordinate them effectively to exhibit a higher level of intelligence."

    "## Organic\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Organic Pattern** enables a natural, adaptive flow of agent interactions without relying on explicit routing rules. This allows the system to dynamically respond to the evolving needs of the conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Characteristics:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Natural Flow:** Agent transitions occur organically, guided by the context and content of the conversation rather than predetermined paths.\n",
    "- **Description-Based Routing:** The Group Chat Manager selects the next agent by evaluating agent descriptions and determining which best matches the current conversation needs.\n",
    "- **Minimal Configuration:** No explicit handoff rules are required, making this the simplest pattern to implement while still supporting sophisticated routing capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach fosters flexibility and adaptability, ensuring that the most suitable agent is engaged at each stage of the conversation.\n",

    "## Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Our implementation using AG2's Group Chat showcases the Organic Pattern with a team of specialized agents. Each agent's area of expertise is clearly defined in their description, enabling the Group Chat Manager to make intelligent, context-driven routing decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Implementation Details:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Descriptive Agent Profiles:**  \n",
    "  Each agent includes a detailed `description` field that outlines their domain expertise and when they should be activated.  \n",
    "  > *Note:* If an agent's `description` is not specified, the `system_message` field will be used instead. However, it is recommended to define `description` separately for optimal use by the Group Chat Manager. See the example below for differences between `description` and `system_message`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Group Chat Manager Configuration:**  \n",
    "  The implementation uses the `GroupManagerTarget` for the chat's \"After Work\" phase, delegating all routing decisions to the Group Chat Manager. The Group Chat Manager is provided with an LLM via the `group_manager_args` parameter on the `AutoPattern`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **No Explicit Handoffs:**  \n",
    "  Unlike other patterns, no explicit handoff rules are required. The Group Chat Manager automatically handles all agent transitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Shared Context:**  \n",
    "  While shared context variables can be used to maintain state across different agents, they are not utilized for routing decisions in this example."

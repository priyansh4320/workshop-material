    "## Pipeline/Sequential\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pipeline Pattern creates a streamlined, sequential processing flow where data moves through a series of specialized transformations. Each agent in the pipeline receives input from its predecessor, performs its specific processing, and passes the result to its successor. This approach simplifies complex workflows by breaking them into discrete, manageable stages.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Specialized Stages: Each agent in the pipeline specializes in a specific type of data transformation or processing task, focusing exclusively on its area of expertise.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unidirectional Flow: Information typically flows in one direction from the beginning to the end of the pipeline, with clear handoffs between stages.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Progressive Refinement: Data is progressively refined, enhanced, and transformed as it moves through each stage, with each agent building upon the work of previous agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Well-Defined Interfaces: Each agent has clear expectations about the format and content of both its inputs and outputs, ensuring smooth transitions between stages."

    "### Implementation\n",
    "Our implementation using AG2's Swarm demonstrates the Pipeline Pattern in an e-commerce order processing workflow. We've created a linear sequence of specialized agents that process an order from initial receipt through notification. The implementation showcases how complex workflows can be broken into discrete, manageable stages with clear responsibilities and interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pipeline begins with an Entry Agent that receives the order data and initiates processing. The order then flows sequentially through specialized stages: Validation checks the order's correctness, Inventory verifies item availability, Payment processes the transaction, Fulfillment prepares shipping instructions, and finally, Notification sends confirmation to the customer. Each agent focuses exclusively on its stage of the process, applying its specialized transformation before passing the enhanced data to the next agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Structured Data Models: Pydantic models define the input/output for each stage, creating clear contracts between pipeline stages and ensuring type safety.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Stage-Specific Functions: Each processing stage has dedicated functions that transform the input, update the shared context, and determine whether to proceed or terminate with an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Strategic Handoffs: AfterWork handlers and context variables manage transitions between agents, with SwarmResult directing the flow based on each stage's outcome."

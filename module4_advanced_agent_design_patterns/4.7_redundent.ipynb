    "## Redundent Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Redundant Pattern, information flows through a coordinated multi-branch process that enables independent processing followed by comparative evaluation, ensuring optimal outcomes through methodological diversity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dispatch Phase: A central coordinator distributes the same task to multiple specialized agents through an isolated nested chat where each agent has access to only the task message.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Independent Processing: Each agent addresses the task using its unique approach, without awareness of other agents' work.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Collection Phase: All results are consolidated once agents have finished providing their responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Evaluation Phase: An evaluator assesses all solutions based on domain-specific criteria and scoring mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Selection or Synthesis: The evaluator either selects the best individual solution or creates a composite result combining strengths from multiple approaches."

    "## Implementation\n",
    "Our implementation using AG2's Swarm demonstrates the Redundant Pattern with a taskmaster that coordinates three agents with distinct approaches, followed by an evaluator that selects or synthesizes the best result. This provides enhanced quality and reliability for tasks where diversity of methods yields valuable insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Specialized Agents: Three agents employ different methodologies - Agent A uses analytical/structured approaches, Agent B uses creative/lateral thinking, and Agent C employs comprehensive/multi-perspective techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Nested Chat: By using a nested chat, the agents can be isolated from the information in the broader orchestration, allowing only the task to be provided to them to respond to.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Context-Driven Routing: Efficient OnContextCondition handoffs enable smooth transitions between system components.\n",

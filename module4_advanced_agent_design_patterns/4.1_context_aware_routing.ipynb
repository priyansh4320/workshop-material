    "## Common Agent Orchestration Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are several advanced patterns for designing and coordinating AI agent workflows:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Context-Aware Routing\n",
    "*Tasks are dynamically assigned to specialized agents based on content analysis, rather than following fixed, predetermined paths.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Escalation\n",
    "*Simple, resource-efficient agents handle tasks first. More capable (and potentially more expensive) agents are only engaged if necessary, optimizing resource usage.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Feedback Loop\n",
    "*Content is iteratively evaluated and improved through repeated cycles, enabling continuous refinement and quality enhancement.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Hierarchical / Tree\n",
    "*Manager agents at higher levels delegate tasks to specialist agents at lower levels. Results are aggregated and refined as they move up the hierarchy.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Organic\n",
    "*Agent selection is determined flexibly by agent descriptions and conversation context, without explicit routing rules. The most appropriate specialist is chosen naturally at each stage.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Pipeline / Sequential Processing\n",
    "*Agents are organized in a linear sequence, with each agent performing a specific action before passing the task to the next agent in the chain.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Redundant\n",
    "*Multiple agents attempt the same task using different approaches. Their results are compared to select the best outcome or to combine their strengths.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Star / Hub-and-Spoke\n",
    "*A central coordinating agent (the \"hub\") manages the workflow, leveraging the expertise of specialized \"spoke\" agents as needed.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. Triage with Tasks\n",
    "*Complex requests are decomposed into categorized, sequential tasks. These are processed by specialized agents in a workflow that respects task dependencies.*\n"

    "## Context-Aware Routing\n",
    "The Context-Aware Routing Pattern creates a dynamic workflow where tasks are intelligently distributed to specialized agents based on content analysis rather than predetermined paths. Unlike static patterns with fixed routes, this approach analyzes each request in real-time to determine the most appropriate specialist, ensuring queries are handled by agents with the most relevant expertise while maintaining conversation continuity even as topics shift across domains.\n",

Unlike static workflows, this pattern dynamically analyzes each query's content and context, ensuring that every request is handled by the most suitable specialist agent. This creates a flexible, hub-and-spoke information flow that adapts in real time to the user's needs.**Workflow Overview:**\n",
    "1. **Analysis Phase:**  \n",
    "   The router examines each request, extracting key domain indicators and identifying user intent.\n",
    "2. **Decision Point:**  \n",
    "   Based on the analysis, the router selects the specialist agent whose expertise best matches the request.\n",
    "3. **Specialization Phase:**  \n",
    "   The chosen domain expert processes the request, applying their specialized knowledge.\n",
    "4. **Return Path:**  \n",
    "   The response is routed back to the user. The router maintains conversation state, enabling context-aware decisions for future requests.This pattern ensures that as topics shift or become more complex, the system can seamlessly redirect queries to the most relevant agents, maintaining both efficiency and high-quality responses."

    " ## Implementation\n",
    " \n",
    " Our implementation leverages AG2's Group Chat to realize the Context-Aware Routing Pattern. At its core, a router agent analyzes each incoming query and intelligently directs it to the most appropriate domain expert. The system continuously maintains and updates contextual information—such as domain history, request patterns, and confidence levels—enabling increasingly sophisticated routing decisions as the conversation progresses.\n",
    " \n",
    " **Key Components:**\n",
    " \n",
    " - **Content Analysis Tools:**  \n",
    "   The router agent employs advanced analysis functions to identify the domain of each query and calculate confidence scores for routing decisions.\n",
    " \n",
    " - **Domain Specialists:**  \n",
    "   Four specialized agents—covering technology, finance, healthcare, and general knowledge—provide targeted, domain-specific expertise.\n",
    " \n",
    " - **Context Variables:**  \n",
    "   Shared context variables track domain history, confidence scores, and previous routing decisions, informing and improving future interactions.\n",
    " \n",
    " - **OnContextCondition Handoffs:**  \n",
    "   Conditional handoffs enable the router to dynamically and efficiently route requests to the appropriate specialist based on real-time domain analysis."

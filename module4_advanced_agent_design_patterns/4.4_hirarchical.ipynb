    "The Hierarchical, or Tree, Orchestration Pattern is a powerful approach to organizing multi-agent workflows, inspired by traditional organizational structures where work and information flow through a well-defined chain of command. This pattern creates a tree-structured arrangement of agents with clear levels of responsibility, specialization, and reporting relationships."

    "- **Explicit Handoffs**  \n",

    "  - *LLM-based fallbacks*: Use `OnCondition` for more complex, language-model-driven decisions.\n",
    "  - *AfterWork designations*: Ensure agents always report back to their supervisors.\n",

    "- **Shared Context Variables**  \n",
    "  - Track progress at different levels.\n",
    "  - Enable deterministic routing based on task completion status.\n",
